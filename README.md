# Cool Interviews and Problems
Some C++, C and Python problems that I saw during interviews or while preparing for one.

Some code will compile as stand alone project; while the others might need a bit of TLC to compile and work.
For C++/C, I am making sure that most of the files are working using gcc/clang on Ubuntu 20.04 dev env.
I am also using PyCharm for Python projects which version is >= 3.10.

For games/big projects, will provide CMake/Make files.

Future Work: will add GoLang, ML and AI sections.
